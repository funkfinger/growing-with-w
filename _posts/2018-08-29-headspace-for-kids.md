W has been going through a fidgety phase at bedtime. 

Most nights at around 7:15pm we start our routine: Put on jammies, brush teeth, fill out our [daily question book](https://www.amazon.com/Q-Day-Kids-Three-Year-Journal/dp/0307952967/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1529818865&sr=8-1&keywords=daily+questions+for+kids "Daily question book"), he reads, I read, then I lie with him until he falls asleep.

Sometimes I lie there for five minutes. Other nights he pulls on the covers. He kicks off the covers. He puts his feet on my body. He turns. He turns again. He might ask a question. He might ask 12.

During those times, we might talk about mindful breaths and relaxing his body. Sometimes these methods work, but lately he’s had a harder time working through his energy.

When a friend mentioned that she used the online app [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/ "Headspace") with her kids, I figured it would be worth a try.

I downloaded the app and selected the “sleep” icon under the “Kids” menu. I selected “1 min” just to get a feel. A soothing British man directed us to relax our bodies.

That one minute made me drowsy. It couldn’t hurt to try.

**Night 1:**

As prompted by the recording, W reached down and touched his toes…and said goodnight to them.

**Night 2:**

He listened quietly...and went to sleep relatively easily.

**Night 3:**

“Mommy, can you put in your headphones if you want to listen to your phone?”

**Verdict:** The soothing voice helps settle my son down…IF he is in the mood. It’s free...so why not try?

Got any ideas to wind down fidgety kids? I'd love to hear them.

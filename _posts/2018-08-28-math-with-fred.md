A couple of years ago, someone told me about [Life of Fred](https://www.lifeoffred.uniquemath.com/ "Life of Fred") math books.

I’m not sure if this friend used them, or heard they were good, but being a person who needs only the flimsiest of excuses to purchase a book, I ordered a couple.

At first look, the books are…weird; Hard bound slim volumes with terrible design and even worse illustrations. But inside, they are actually a little magical.

The books tell the story of Fred, a 5 year-old math professor at Kittens University who lives in his office with his doll, Kingie. Fred is unusually small with no parents and terrible eating habits — but he is kind and trusting, which has gotten him into a few predicaments.

Through the book, we slowly learn principles of basic math, along with some more complicated ideas like functions, put into totally easy-to-understand terms. But the books also touch on other things, like telling time, deciduous trees, making good decisions — mixed into a totally engaging story.

For the past two summers, W and I have done a chapter in the morning before he watches TV. Each chapter takes at most, 10 minutes, and has a couple of questions at the end. Sometimes the questions are math. Sometimes they are math disguised as something else. Sometimes they are actually something else.

The books, like many home-school resources, have a touch of God, but it’s more of an afterthought.

We’re on the fifth book now and it just got into adding double-digit numbers. Like I said, it moves slowly. But we’re finding it’s an pretty pain-free way to get a little education.

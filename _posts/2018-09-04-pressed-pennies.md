You know you’ve seen them littering state parks, museums, and zoos from Pennsylvania to Paris.

The machines that, for 50 cents (plus a sacrificial penny) will smash your coin into an oblong disk, stamp a design into it, and voila…turn it into a valuable keepsake. 

In the past, you might have passed that machine and thought, “who in their right mind needs a flat penny with a stamp on it?”

I’ll tell you who. Your child needs that penny.

I too used to scoff at the pressed penny machine. But now as a traveling parent of a child who loves mementos, I wish I hadn’t been so dismissive of that flat penny. When kids travel, they want something…anything. As parents, you can buy t-shirts, stuffed animals, or books. You can tell your tired child who has been sitting in the car/train/plane for hours waiting to get to this destination, “You don’t need anything from this gift shop, you have your memories,” and deal with the aftermath. Or…you can buy a flattened penny that costs 51 cents and fits in your pocket.

They are cheap. They are portable. They can be displayed in books (like [here](https://www.amazon.com/Penny-Passport/dp/B00XHH0UG2/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1500009102&sr=8-3&keywords=pressed+pennies "penny book")), made into a charm bracelet (like [this](http://whatido.com/posts/souvenir-pressed-penny-bracelet "pressed penny charm bracelet")) or put in a jar to gather dust (a very small jar, they aren’t that big).

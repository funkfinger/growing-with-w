**Got a road trip? Try an audiobook**

When my family travels in an airplane together, it’s every person for himself.

My 7 year-old son can sit through any intercontinental flight with an iPad, only disconnecting from the screen to use the bathroom or shove some snacks in his mouth.

My husband also defaults to tech, carrying his computer, phone and maybe some programming obsession.

I board a flight with an aspirational 40-pound backpack filled with books, magazines, and sketch pad — all of which I furiously flip through, afraid of frittering even a moment of this precious time.

Road trips, on the other hand, we engage as a family.

In the past we’ve spent lengthy car rides listening to my son’s favorite music-du-jour (two hours of Weird Al). But on a recent trip 4-hour trip from Phoenix to Rocky Point, I signed up for [Audible](http://www.audible.com "Audible") and we gave an audiobook a whirl. The hours flew by as we listened to [_The Adventures of Pippi Longstocking_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B4RIZDM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00B4RIZDM&linkCode=as2&tag=cracgood-20&linkId=038a6ef89a4e5fbcef790e163f2b56e1 "The Adventures of Pippi Longstocking"). Each chapter was it’s own story complete story, so we could listen in parts, or power through.

My son enjoyed it so much, he requested re-listening to it on the way home.

Since that trip, we have listened to a load of other books varying in length and subject matter.

Here are some we’ve enjoyed so far…

1. [**_Blackthorn Key_**](https://amzn.to/2LDGe9v "Blackthorn Key") (3 book series), A riveting story of cracking codes and mystery-solving featuring apprentice apothecary, Christopher Rowe. Hint: Fast-forward through the tedious symbol keys.
2. [**_The Mysterious Benedict Society_**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NUOJFY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000NUOJFY&linkCode=as2&tag=cracgood-20&linkId=6348c5c46cb97852a96d28f003f8c227 "The Mysterious Benedict Society") (3 book series)**_,_** This book about gifted orphans saving the world is gripping for the adults just as much as the kids. When we first tuned in, my then 6 year-old son complained, “this is for grown-ups.” But after about 10 minutes and he was hooked.
3. [**_Secret Keepers_**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KGEMUMK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01KGEMUMK&linkCode=as2&tag=cracgood-20&linkId=1c81a20a107812d0c2dc8d5acf03b2b0 "Secret Keepers"), Written by the same author as _The Mysterious Benedict Society_ (above), it's another problem-solving mystery about a boy who finds a watch that makes him invisible. Adventure ensues.
4. [**_The War that Saved My Life_**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QTTUZDI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00QTTUZDI&linkCode=as2&tag=cracgood-20&linkId=98182877ea59460171f8ea19cec899db "The War that Saved My Life") (two book series), The World War 2 story about an abused girl and her brother evacuating London and finding a new life.
5. [**_Wonder_**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0078XQPBA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0078XQPBA&linkCode=as2&tag=cracgood-20&linkId=3ddd8d0b3ed70321a5c83d30e118594f "Wonder"), This story hooked my son with jokes about a name synonymous with “butt,” and kept him with a heartfelt and relatable story about fitting in.

I've heard great things about the narration of the Harry Potter series.

(For adults looking to try a book sans kids, I whole-heartedly recommend Trevor Noah’s [_Born a Crime_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IW9TM5O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01IW9TM5O&linkCode=as2&tag=cracgood-20&linkId=7401aef8a81ffe053622a585eb95bb62 "Born a Crime").)

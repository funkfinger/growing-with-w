Growing With W Jekyll site

## using gem-based theme - growing-with-w-theme

The theme was created as gem based theme with Jekyll's default theme [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) as a starting point.

Here is a way to connect the `gem` to the local repo so that I don't need to version bump and `bundle install` all of the time...

    bundle config local.growing-with-w-theme /path/to/local/growing-with-w-theme
